""[2]: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equilibrium 
""[3]: https://www.britannica.com/science/equilibrium-physics 
""[4]: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/equilibrium 
""[5]: http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/ 
""**Equilibrium** refers to a state of balance between opposing forces or actions. Let's break it down:
1. **Intellectual or Emotional Balance**: Equilibrium can describe a state of intellectual or emotional poise, where someone maintains stability and composure[^1^][2]. For instance, when trying to recover their equilibrium after a challenging situation.
2. **Adjustment Between Opposing Influences**: It also represents a state of adjustment between opposing or divergent influences or elements. Imagine finding equilibrium between commercial development and the conservation of natural treasures[^1^][2].
3. **Physical Balance**: In physics, equilibrium refers to a system where neither its motion nor its internal energy state tends to change over time. This can be either static (as in a balanced body acted upon by forces with a net resultant of zero) or dynamic (as in a reversible chemical reaction with equal rates in both directions)[^2^][3].
4. **Symbolism**: The word "equilibrium" has roots in the Latin word "libra," meaning "weight" or "balance." As a constellation, zodiac symbol, and astrological sign, Libra is often depicted as a set of balance scales, symbolizing fairness, equality, and justice[^1^][2].Remember, equilibrium appears in various contexts, including biology, chemistry, physics, and economics, but the common thread is always the balance of competing influences[^1^][2]. 
If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š'''
oldinp = '''Certainly! Let's break down each concept and identify key search phrases for relevant static images:

        1. **Creating Functions**:
            - Search phrases: "defining functions in Python," "user-defined functions," "function parameters," "return statement."
            - Summary: Functions in programming allow you to encapsulate reusable code. They take input (parameters), perform specific tasks, and optionally return a result. The syntax for defining a function in Python is straightforward: `def function_name(parameters):`. The body of the function contains the code to be executed when the function is called[^1^][1].

        2. **Decomposition**:
            - Search phrases: "Algorithmic decomposition," "structured analysis," "object-oriented decomposition," "functional decomposition."
            - Summary: Decomposition involves breaking down complex problems or systems into smaller, manageable parts. Different types of decomposition exist, including algorithmic decomposition (structured steps), structured analysis (system functions and data entities), and object-oriented decomposition (classes or objects). Functional decomposition replaces a system's functional model with subsystem models[^2^][5].

        3. **While Loops**:
            - Search phrases: "While loop in programming," "entry-controlled loops," "condition-based repetition."
            - Summary: While loops execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. They evaluate the condition before each iteration, execute the code block if the condition is true, and terminate when the condition becomes false. Useful for uncertain or dynamically changing situations[^3^][9].

        4. **For Loops**:
            - Search phrases: "For loop in programming," "iterating over a sequence," "fixed number of iterations."
            - Summary: For loops execute a set of statements repetitively based on a specified condition. They are commonly used when you know how many times you want to execute a block of code. The syntax includes initialization, condition, and increment (or decrement) components. Useful for iterating over sequences or performing a fixed number of tasks[^4^][13].

        Feel free to use these search phrases to find relevant static images that enhance student comprehension!
